# McHack9-Chrome-Extension
Conscious Consumer is a Chrome Extension that suggests local and sustainable shopping alternatives to customers. Built during [McHacks9!](https://devpost.com/software/conscious-consumer-l6a2sd) The front-end was built with React.js and Bootstrap. The back-end was built with Python, Flask and CockroachDB.

This repo is our Chrome Extension's front-end, so be sure to checkout our [back-end](https://github.com/arikaufman/mchacks22backend) too!

## Overview

### Inspiration
We admired the convenience Honey provides for finding coupon codes. We wanted to apply the same concept except towards making more sustainable purchases online.

### What it does 
Recommends sustainable and local business alternatives when shopping online.

### How we built it
Front-end was built with React.js and Bootstrap. The back-end was built with Python, Flask and CockroachDB. 

### Challenges we ran into
Difficulties setting up the environment across the team, especially with cross-platform development in the back-end. Extracting the current URL from a webpage was also challenging.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a working product!
Successful end-to-end data pipeline.

### What we learned
We learned how to implement a Chrome Extension. Also learned how to deploy to Heroku, and set up/use a database in CockroachDB. 

### What's next for Conscious Consumer
First, it's important to expand to make it easier to add local businesses. We want to continue improving the relational algorithm that takes an item on a website, and relates it to a similar local business in the user's area. Finally, we want to replace the ESG rating scraping with a corporate account with rating agencies so we can query ESG data easier.
